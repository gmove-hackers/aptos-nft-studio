The Move language enables advanced NFT features that are unavailable in popular standards like Solidity, but accessing these capabilities require technical expertise, making it complex and costly for non-coders.

The Move NFT Studio is a one stop shop for dynamic and composable NFT's. Creators can create collections, add combinations, evolutions and more. Users can then not only mint the NFT on the frontend, but also use the Move NFT Studio to interact with the NFT in whatever way the creator has configured it. The possibilities are endless!

‚öôÔ∏è Built using Move, React, Vite, shadcn/ui and tailwind.

- üó≥Ô∏è **Easily create NFT collections**: With our intuitive creation page, creators can easily create new collections.
- üíó **Dynamic NFT's**: Move NFT Studio allows creators to create dynamic collections, in any way they can imagine. Combine two NFT's, or allow NFT's to evolve after certain criteria have been met. The sky is the limit!
- üèóÔ∏è **Composable NFT's**: Creators can define rules for equipment related to their collection. NFT holders can use Move NFT Studio to discover all the ways they can use or equip their NFT's.
